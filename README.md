# TODO

- implement a measure for not picking up restores as new copy instances
- make the widget shortcut-available (e.g. background daemon still runs when it is closed, and the widget can be pulled up with a keyboard shortcut)
- filters on history, autopurging based on user settings
- settings tab for customizability
